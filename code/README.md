# Programming #

This Project currently lacks the whole programming/software part. Luckily Maarten Weyn already made the inverse kinematics work and wrote also an Smartphone App for simple Control of this Robot via BLE. Take a look into his Repository as well:
https://github.com/maartenweyn/SpotMicro_ESP32

An walking gait implementation and voice-commanding was achieved by Guna R. from the slacks #spotmicro-esp32 channel, whis is build upon Maartens software (see Repo above). You definitly have to take a look there as well and contribute:

**Work-in-Progress : still a lot to do**

This section currently contains some basic test-programs for servo-calibration and circuit-/module-tests.

## Arduino IDE ##

You can use the Arduino IDE for the developement of your ESP32 programs. A good resource for the setup can be found here:

## ESP-IDF ##

The ESP-IDF is the developement framework provided by Espressif. Here's how you get startet:
